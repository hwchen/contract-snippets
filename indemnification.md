If any such Work Product, or any portion thereof, becomes, or in the reasonable opinion of Service Provider is likely to become, or is found by final, non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction to be such an infringement or misappropriation, Service Provider, at its option nd expense, shall have the right to (x) procure for Client the continued use of such Work Product, (y) replace such Work Product with non-infringing work product, or (z) modify such Work Product so it becomes non-infringing; provided that, if (y) or (z) is the option chosen by Service Provider, the replacement or modified Work Product is capable of performing substantially the same function. As a condition to the foregoing indemnity obligations, Client shall provide Service Provider with prompt notice of any claim for which indemnification shall be sought hereunder and shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with Service Provider in connection with any such claim. Client’s failure to give prompt notice shall not constitute a waiver of the Client’s right to indemnification and shall affect Service Provider’s indemnification obligations only to the extent that Service Provider’s rights are materially prejudiced by such failure or delay. Service Provider shall be entitled to control the handling of any such claim and to defend or settle any such claim, in its sole discretion, with counsel of its own choosing, provided that Client’s written approval shall be required for any settlement other than the payment of money or release of any claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, (i) the Client may participate, at its own expense, in any defense and settlement directly or through counsel of its choice. If Service Provider elects in writing not to defend or settle any such claim for which it is obligated to do so hereunder, or if Service Provider fails to do so promptly after receipt of notice of such claim and Client notifies Service Provider of Client’s intent to defend or settle the claim and Service Provider still fails to do so within five (5) business days of receipt of such notice, the Client will have the right to defend or settle the claim as it may deem appropriate, at the cost and expense of Service Provider, and Service Provider will promptly reimburse the Client for all costs, expenses, and settlement amounts for which it is obligated to indemnify and hold harmless Client hereunder. The foregoing provisions of this paragraph constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Client, and the sole and exclusive obligation of Service Provider, relating to a claim that the Work Products infringes or misappropriates any patent, copyright or other intellectual property right of a third party.
